# SOF Wx

SOF Wx is a tool for United States Air Force (USAF) Supervisors of Flying (SOFs).  The intent is to make SOFs' lives easier by automating the process of applying Air Force Instruction [(AFI) 11-202v3](https://www.e-publishing.af.mil/Product-Index/#/?view=search&keyword=11-202v3&isObsolete=false&modID=449&tabID=131) rules to the TAFs for a given list of possible alternates.  Data is pulled from the Aviation Weather Center (AWC)'s text data server and presented in a simple, easy-to-read stoplight chart.
